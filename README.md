## Simple linear regression

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values.

### Basic equation
y = a + bx

### Ordinary least squares (The line is the MIN of the SUM of SQUARES)
sum ( (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2) )
